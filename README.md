My name is Cindy Yeh and I am a computational biologist at GigaGen, Inc. 

- ðŸ˜„ **Pronouns**: she/her
- ðŸ¦‚ **Background**: I grew up in New Mexico. As an undergraduate at NMSU, I studied muscle degeneration and transdifferentiation in the weakly electric fish _Sternopygus macrurus_.
- ðŸŒ² **Training**: I spent an amazing 6 years in Seattle obtaining my PhD in Genome Sciences at the University of Washington where I studied natural allelic variation in the budding yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_.
- ðŸ§¬ **Profession**: I previously worked at Ultima Genomics as a scientist where I developed assays and analysis pipelines for the next-generation model of short-read sequencers.
- ðŸ”­ **Interests**: I love learning about yeast genomes and new bioinformatics tricks
- ðŸŒ± **What I'm doing now**: Iâ€™m currently learning about LLMs...and how to upgrade my GitHub profile!
- ðŸ‘¯ **Fun fact**: I worked alongside the godfather of tie dye, Paul Kenney. He's a clever chemist!
