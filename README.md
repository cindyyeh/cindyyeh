My name is Cindy Yeh and I am a computational biologist at GigaGen, Inc. 

- ðŸ˜„ **Pronouns**: she/her
- ðŸ¦‚ **Background**: I grew up in New Mexico. 
- ðŸŒ² **Training**: As an undergraduate at NMSU, I studied muscle degeneration and transdifferentiation in the weakly electric fish _Sternopygus macrurus_ in the lab of Dr. Graciela Unguez. I then moved to Seattle to pursue my PhD in Genome Sciences at the University of Washington in the lab of Dr. Maitreya Dunham where I studied natural allelic variation in the budding yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_.
- ðŸ§¬ **Profession**: I previously worked at Ultima Genomics as a scientist where I developed assays and analysis pipelines for Ultima's emerging iteration of short-read sequencers. This was a hybrid wet/dry lab role, but I shifted to a fully computational role when I started my position at GigaGen. As a bioinformatician, I help analyze biological datasets and develop new tools for our polyclonal antibody drug discovery platform.
- ðŸ”­ **Interests**: Outside the lab, I love working on jigsaw puzzles, hiking/swimming, playing team sports, and (unfortunately, I know) playing LoL.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Fun fact**: I worked alongside the godfather of tie dye, Paul Kenney. He's a clever chemist!
